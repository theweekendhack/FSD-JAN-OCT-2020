## CSS Specificity

CSS Specificity is the set of the rules applied to CSS selectors in order to determine which style is applied to an element. 
The more specific a CSS style is, the higher point value it accrues, and the likelier it is to be present on the element's style
Specificity is based on the matching rules which are composed of different sorts of CSS selectors.

### Specificity Hierarcy
Every selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy. There are four categories which define the specificity level of a selector:

  * Inline styles
  * IDs
  * Classes, attributes pseudo classes
  * Elements and pseudo elements
