## CSS Grids

CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer,
between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.

Grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows.A grid container's child elements could position
themselves so they actually overlap and layer.

### What is a grid?
A grid is an intersecting set of horizontal and vertical lines – one set defining columns, and the other, rows.
Elements can be placed onto the grid, within these column and row lines. 


### CSS grid layout has the following features:

#### Fixed and flexible track sizes
You can create a grid with fixed track sizes – using pixels for example. 
This sets the grid to the specified pixel which fits to the layout you desire. 
You can also create a grid using flexible sizes with percentages or with the new fr unit designed for this purpose.

#### Item placement
You can place items into a precise location on the grid using line numbers, names or by targeting an area of the grid. 


#### Creation of additional tracks to hold content
You can define an explicit grid with grid layout. 
The Grid Layout specification is flexible enough to add additional rows and columns when needed.


####  Alignment control
Grid contains alignment features so we can control how the items align once placed into a grid area, and how the entire grid is aligned.
