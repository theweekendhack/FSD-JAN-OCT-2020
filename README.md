## WEB PROGRAMMING I (Container Elements-Both Semantic and Non-Semantic
This project explores container elements,specifically structural elemetns that allow you to break up your page into various sections.
See the following :
* header
  * The HTML <header> element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. 
  It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.
* footer
  * The HTML <footer> element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. 
  A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.
* nav
  * The HTML <nav> element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, 
  either within the current document or to other documents. As mentioned in class, a common practice for the <nav> block is
   to contain an unordered list (<ul>) of links. With the appropriate CSS,  this can be presented as a sidebar, navigation bar, 
   or drop-down menu.
* main 
  * The HTML <main> element represents the dominant content of the <body> of a document. 
  The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, 
  or the central functionality of an application.The content of a <main> element should be unique to the document. Content that is repeated across a set of documents or
  document sections such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms shouldn't be 
  included unless the search form is the main function of the page.
* aside
* article
* section
* div
* span
