## WEB PROGRAMMING I (Skeleton code)
This HTML file just has the skeleton code that every single document should have :
* DOCTYPE -In HTML, the doctype is the required "<!DOCTYPE html>" preamble found at the top of all documents. Its sole purpose is to prevent a browser from switching into so-called “quirks mode” when rendering a document; that is, the "<!DOCTYPE html>" doctype ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications, rather than using a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications.
* html- The HTML <html> element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element.  All other elements must be descendants of this element.
* head  -The HTML <head> element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets. The metadata that is placed in the document is not displayed in the web browser
* title - The HTML Title element (<title>) defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text; tags within the element are ignored.
* body -The HTML <body> Element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one <body> element in a document.
